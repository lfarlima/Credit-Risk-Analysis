# Credit Risk Analysis
 Machine Learning using Resampling and Ensemble Models
 
 ## Credit Risk Resampling Models

 ### 1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

 * *The Undersampling and Combined (Over and Under) Sampling models produced the best balance accuracy scores (0.9934649587814939).*


 ### 2. Which model had the best recall score?

 * *Each of the resampling models (Combined, Random Oversampling, SMOTE algorithm, and Undersampling), each generated the highest recall for both high_risk and low_risk (99%).*


### 3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?

 * *All the models generated a 99% geometric mean score.*


## Credit Risk Ensemble Models

### 1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

 * *The Random Forest model generated the best balance accuracy score (0.7887%).*

 ### 2. Which model had the best recall score?

 * *The Random Forest model generated the best recall score (0.7887%).*

 ### 3. Which model had the best geometric mean score?

 * *The Random Forest model produced the best geometric mean score (0.78 vs. 0.61)*

 ### 4. What are the top three features?

 * *The top three features are 'total_rec_prncp' (0.07876809003486353),'total_pymnt' (0.05883806887524815), and 'total_pymnt_inv' (0.05625613759225244).*
